comparelength <- function(v1, v2){
  
  diff <- length(v1) - length(v2)
  return(diff)
  
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function


# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"


# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
